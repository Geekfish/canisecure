Below are some general guidelines that are applicable to all areas of your digital life.

-   Strong Passwords: Many sites in your digital life will have minimum password requirements. While this is better than nothing, you should always choose the longest and most complex password the system will accept. In many cases this would be 100 characters in length and a mix of numbers, letters (upper and lower case) and symbols. Remembering unique random strings 100 characters in length is unrealistic. This is where a password manager comes in to play.

-   Password Manager: This is a tool that you would install on your system to securely store all of your passwords in an encrypted vault. There are many vendors and open-source projects that offer tools to accomplish this same goal. Choose one that has a decent community or customer following and make sure you decide which features are best for your lifestyle and turn off those you don't need. If you select a cloud-based password manager, be very sure you select one that is a market leader (e.g., [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)) and ensure that you have selected a very strong master password.

-   Multi-Factor or Two-Factor Authentication: Most sites today will also offer you the ability to add another step in the authentication process. This is sometimes referred to as 2nd factor (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA). Always turn this on. There are varying degrees of security associated with the different methods (SMS, Software Authenticator, Hardware Token) but any 2nd factor is better than a single factor which is commonly a username and password. A hardware token like a Yubikey is considered the best form of MFA/2FA today. Consider that as your top choice if it is an option from the service you are using.

-   Note: Be VERY careful with SMS-based 2FA. If this is tied to your actual carrier phone number and your get SIM ported, the attacker could possibly reset your account password. Consider a burner phone or a Google Voice number to use for SMS-based 2FA when it is the only option.

-   Software Updates: Every computer, mobile device and other connected device you have in your digital world likely has software that will need to be updated. It is important that you get into a habit of installing software updates when they become available as they usually contain critical security fixes for the product you are using. The most important thing here to note is that once the update is released, the bad guys will also know about the vulnerability and diligently work in the limited time before everyone is patched to exploit the problem the update is fixing. It is fair to not want to be the first to update, in case there happens to be an issue with the update, but you certainly do not want to be the slowest either.

Personal Email
--------------

Your personal email is the gateway to most of your digital life. Important accounts such as your bank account, social media, mobile carrier, ISP settings, etc. are tied to your email. Someone with access to your personal email can easily shutdown or disrupt your personal life in just a few minutes. You MUST ensure that you have your email accounts protected with a strong password and two-step authentication.

This is not optional. If you are reading this and know you have a weak password and/or do not have 2FA/MFA enabled, turn this on now. Stop reading this guide and make it happen.
