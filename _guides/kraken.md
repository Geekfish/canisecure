**Basic (must do)**

1.  Set up [**Two-factor Authentication** (2FA)](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000426923) for [**login**](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000911823-How-does-Two-factor-Authentication-2FA-for-login-work-), ideally using a [Yubikey](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000444186-What-is-a-Yubikey-), and [do not back it up in an unsecure way](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001486466-How-to-find-the-backup-code-for-authenticator-app-2FA)! This is the most important security feature. 
2.  Set up a [**Master Key**](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000444923) to require authentication for password resets. Make sure the Master Key is set up using a different method from Login 2FA. For example, if you use a Yubikey for Login 2FA, then use authenticator app or a different Yubikey for the Master Key.
3.  [Secure the **email account** registered to your Kraken account](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021870651) with a strong password and Two-factor Authentication (2FA). [Remove any and all phone numbers from your email account](https://blog.kraken.com/post/219/security-advisory-mobile-phones/).

**Beware of the following (must know)**

-   [Phishing scams](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012482687-Beware-of-phishing-scams). Even Login 2FA can't protect your account if you enter it on a phishing website or share it with a scammer.
-   [Phone support scams](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012482487-Beware-of-phone-scams).
-   [Phone number hijacking](https://blog.kraken.com/post/219/security-advisory-mobile-phones/). 

**Advanced (optional)**

-   Set up **Two-factor Authentication** (2FA) for [**withdrawals**](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000911763-How-does-two-factor-authentication-2FA-for-Deposits-Withdrawals-work-) and [**trading**](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000911503-How-does-Two-factor-Authentication-2FA-for-Trading-work-). However, the Global Settings Lock must be enabled in order for these 2FAs to be effective.
-   Enable the [**Global Settings Lock** (GSL)](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/201396877) to prevent changes to your account settings and withdrawal addresses --- even if an attacker gains access to your account.
    - *Important: If you want the option to immediately turn off the GSL at any time, you'll need to setup the **Master Key** before enabling the GSL. Kraken Support cannot speed up GSL removal.*
-   If your [email application](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/203058116-How-do-I-set-up-PGP-GPG-encryption-for-my-email-) supports **[PGP](https://support.kraken.com/hc/articles/201648223-What-is-PGP-encryption-)** signing and encryption, provide us with your PGP public key to [receive signed and encrypted email from Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024331812-How-do-I-receive-PGP-GPG-encrypted-emails-from-Kraken-).
