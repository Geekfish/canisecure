### Use a strong password

As with everything, [make sure you use a strong password](/guides/passwords) for both your Twitter account and the email account associated with it.

### Use Two-Factor Authentication

While not ideal, Twitter does not yet support using authorization apps such as Authenticator, Authy, or physical Yubikeys. In the meantime, the next best thing is "[login verification](https://twitter.com/settings/account/login_verification)" which prompts you for an SMS text message when logging in on a new device. While this doesn't protect against SIM swapping attacks, you can potentially decrease the likelihood of this happening if you register with a Google Voice number.

### Delete your location

Sharing your location could allow someone to find your physical location. While that might not seem like a big deal at first, people have [reportedly been robbed based on the timing and location of their tweets](https://www.cnet.com/news/twitter-user-says-vacation-tweets-led-to-burglary/).

### Remove or Limit Applications

Each time you connect Twitter with an application, you are increasing your attack surface. While most Twitter apps are innocuous, a flaw in a third-party application means someone may be able to gain access to your Twitter data [using the application](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/15/twitter-counter-hacked/). Be especially cautious around applications that have both read and write permissions, as this means the worst case scenario is that someone could send a tweet as you.

### Opt out of Twitter's personalization

To remove the sharing of personalized information to other parties such as 3rd party advertisters, go to "**Privacy and Safety**" and turn off everything under "**Personalization and Data**".
