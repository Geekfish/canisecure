Set Master Password
===================

Thunderbird can save passwords for each account you have set up, so you don't have to re-enter them when you check for new messages, which allows you to view them and remove the ones you don't use anymore. If you share a computer and don't want others to see your stored passwords, the master password feature will help. Thunderbird will require you to enter a master password in order to view or use the passwords you've told Thunderbird to remember. When you have a password set, you'll only need to enter it once per session.

1.  At the top of the Thunderbird window, click the "Tools" menu. (if you don't see the menu, hit alt+t) and select "Options"

2.  Select the "Security" panel

3.  Click the "Passwords" tab

4.  Tick the box that says "Use a master password"

To view and delete saved passwords you have on Thunderbird:

1.  At the top of the Thunderbird window click the "Tools" menu. (if you don't see the menu, hit alt+t) and select "Options"

2.  Go to the "Security" panel, select "Passwords" tabs and click "Saved Passwords"

3.  To delete a password, click the password you want to delete and click "Remove"

Enable Antivirus
================

By default, Thunderbird stores mail folders locally in single files (For example, there's a file called Inbox). If your antivirus software detects a virus in a new incoming message, it will quarantine the entire inbox file. With this setting enabled, incoming messages will be stored in a temporary folder on your computer, before being moved to your Thunderbird inbox. That way, your antivirus software will only quarantine the single message.

1.  At the top of the Thunderbird window click the "Tools" menu. (if you don't see the menu, hit alt+t) and select "Options"

2.  Go to the "Security" tab and click "Antivirus"

3.  Check the box "Allow antivirus to quarantine individual messages" ![](/assets/images/thunderbirdav.png){:width="50%"}

Detect Scam Messages
====================

A scam message contains material designed to trick you into disclosing personal information. With this setting enabled, Thunderbird will display a warning if it detects the message you are reading is a scam.

1.  At the top of the Thunderbird window click the "Tools" menu. (if you don't see the menu, hit alt+t) and select "Options"

2.  Go to the "Security" tab and click "Email-Scams"
